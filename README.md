# Writer's Block Helper: Where Your Ideas Go to Thrive (or at Least Survive)

Are you tired of staring at a blank screen, desperately trying to wrangle your ideas into something coherent? Fear not, dear writer! This simple webpage was created as a fun weekend project to help me (and hopefully you) overcome writer's block. 

I enlisted the help of Chat GPT, the writing assistant that's almost as good as a human (but not quite). Together, we crafted a text box where you can type your ideas and a "Copy Text" button that allows you to easily move on to the next section of your writing without the burden of backspace weighing you down. Simply click the button, and the copied text can be pasted into a new document or app, allowing you to easily pick up where you left off (or at least pretend you know what you're doing). 

So go ahead, give it a try. Who knows, maybe with a little help from Chat GPT and a backspace-free text box, you'll be able to write that Great American Novel (or at least a grocery list that doesn't have ketchup listed as a vegetable).
